# The Parking Space

The Parking Space is a Mini Project developed to solve the problems faced by people at parking lots in malls. This helps people determine the parking space available on a monitor and will help reduce the hassle while trying to find a parking spot. (http://theparkingspace.000webhostapp.com)
